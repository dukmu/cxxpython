# Development Status

## 2026-05-17

Current phase: Milestone 0/1 bootstrap.

Completed:

- Initialized repository and documentation set.
- Added CMake build skeleton.
- Added `cxxpython_core` library.
- Added minimal CLI program.
- Added first TDD slice for core object semantics:
  - `object`/`type` bootstrap.
  - `None`, `bool`, `int`, `str`, `tuple`, `dict`.
  - `bool` as an `int` subtype.
  - `True == 1`, matching hash values, and dict key merging.
  - tuple keys in dict.

Next:

- Start compiler/VM planning only after the foundation remains stable.

## 2026-05-17 Core Object Architecture Hardening

Completed:

- Removed the parallel `ObjectKind` semantic dispatch path.
- Moved core behavior to virtual object methods:
  - `repr`
  - `hash`
  - `equals`
  - `truth`
  - `visit_children`
- Replaced host `std::invalid_argument` error paths in object/dict/hash behavior
  with `PythonError`.
- Kept `bool` as an `int` subtype structurally and semantically.
- Added explicit runtime heap/root APIs:
  - `visit_heap`
  - `visit_roots`
  - `add_root`
  - `remove_root`
  - `heap_size`
  - `root_count`
- Added tests proving custom object semantics can extend behavior without
  editing central switch statements.
- Added tests for Python error paths and child traversal.

Verification:

- `cmake --build build -j2`
- `ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure`

Result: all tests pass.

## 2026-05-17 TypeObject Slot Dispatch

Completed:

- Replaced C++ virtual semantic dispatch with CPython-style type slot dispatch.
- Added `TypeSlots` for the current object protocol:
  - `repr`
  - `hash`
  - `equal`
  - `truth`
  - `traverse`
- Moved builtin behavior into explicit slot factories for:
  - `object`
  - `type`
  - `NoneType`
  - `int`
  - `bool`
  - `str`
  - `tuple`
  - `dict`
- Added `Runtime::new_heap_type` so tests and future class support can create
  heap types without editing central object code.
- Added slot inheritance from base type to derived heap type.
- Kept the bootstrap invariant that builtin types are ordinary `TypeObject`
  instances whose behavior is also slot-driven.
- Added tests proving custom slot behavior, slot inheritance, heap type
  `is_instance`, builtin bool/int semantics, dict key merging, Python error
  paths, and child traversal.

Design notes:

- `Object` now owns identity and type pointer only. Python-visible semantics
  belong to `TypeObject`, which avoids baking behavior into C++ subclasses.
- The current MRO implementation is single-inheritance only. Multiple
  inheritance must use a real C3 linearization before user classes are exposed.
- `PythonError` is still a string-typed transitional exception carrier. The
  next hardening step is runtime-owned Python exception objects/types.

Verification:

- `cmake --build build -j2`
- `ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure`

Result: all tests pass.
